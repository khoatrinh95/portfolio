            <p>Hi there! I'm Khoa (pronounced 'Kwa', like the French word quoi) —a software engineer turned artist based in Montreal, Quebec. I grew up in Vietnam and moved to Canada at the age of 15. Ever since I was 8, painting has been my way of processing the world. Every piece I create holds a personal story, and I hope that in sharing them, something resonates with you too.</p>
            <p>All of my work is painted digitally, stroke by stroke, with the same care and intention as a traditional canvas. Coming from a background in technology, I don’t view the digital medium as separate from art, but as a powerful extension of it — a tool that can amplify creativity when used with purpose. There’s a paradox at the heart of it that inspires me: ones and zeros, inherently cold and mechanical, are not meant to carry emotion. Yet when I can breathe life and feeling into them through digital brushstrokes, I know I’ve created something meaningful.</p>

            <p>What is Das Haus Von Quoi?</p>
            <p>“Das Haus” is German for “the house”—a nod to the Bauhaus art movement, which first sparked my love for graphic and digital art. Its bold forms, experimental spirit, and belief in blending disciplines continue to shape how I think about creating.</p>
            <p>“Quoi” is my nickname. It sounds like my real name, Khoa, but comes from a very different place—Quebec, where I live now. After countless moments where people misheard or misspelled my Vietnamese name, the word “quoi” (French for “what”) stuck. It became a part of how I navigate identity across languages and cultures.</p>
            <p>Together, Das Haus Von Quoi means “The House of Quoi”—a creative space that holds all the pieces of where I’ve been, what I love, and who I’m becoming.</p>
