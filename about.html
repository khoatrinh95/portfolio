            <p>Hi there! I'm Khoa (pronounced 'Kwa', like the French word quoi) —a software engineer turned artist based in Montreal, Quebec. I grew up in Vietnam and moved to Canada at the age of 15. Ever since I was 8, painting has been my way of processing the world. Every piece I create holds a personal story, and I hope that in sharing them, something resonates with you too.</p>
            <p>All of my work is now created primarily with oil pastels, small layered pieces built stroke by stroke with the same care and intention as a traditional canvas. I am drawn to the medium for its texture, softness, and physical presence, and for the way it allows emotion, memory, and atmosphere to emerge slowly through touch and color.
At the heart of my practice is a fascination with the tension between the technical and the emotional, between systems and sensation, precision and softness. Whether working with pixels or pastel, I am always searching for that moment when something quiet and intangible becomes visible.</p>

            <p>What is Das Haus Von Quoi?</p>
            <p>“Das Haus” is German for “the house”—a nod to the Bauhaus art movement, which first sparked my love for graphic and digital art. Its bold forms, experimental spirit, and belief in blending disciplines continue to shape how I think about creating.</p>
            <p>“Quoi” is my nickname. It sounds like my real name, Khoa, but comes from a very different place—Quebec, where I live now. After countless moments where people misheard or misspelled my Vietnamese name, the word “quoi” (French for “what”) stuck. It became a part of how I navigate identity across languages and cultures.</p>
            <p>Together, Das Haus Von Quoi means “The House of Quoi”—a creative space that holds all the pieces of where I’ve been, what I love, and who I’m becoming.</p>
