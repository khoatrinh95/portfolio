    "desc1": "\"When Logic Fails\" is a modern surrealist art print that merges hyper-realistic textures with an imaginative twist. At the heart of the piece is a digitally hand-painted classical Roman statue, blindfolded, yet not entirely hidden. The blindfold is surrealistically sliced open, offering a glimpse into a world that defies logic.",
    "desc2": "This piece plays with contradiction: marble meets fabric, realism meets surrealism, structure meets distortion. It's for those who find beauty in things that donâ€™t quite make sense, an ode to the curious, the analytical dreamers, and the lovers of paradox"
