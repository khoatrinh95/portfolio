    "desc1": "\"When Logic Fails\" is a modern surrealist art print that merges hyper-realistic textures with an imaginative twist. At the heart of the piece is a digitally hand-painted classical Roman statue, blindfolded, yet not entirely hidden. The blindfold is surrealistically sliced open, offering a glimpse into a world that defies logic.",
    "desc2": "This piece plays with contradiction: marble meets fabric, realism meets surrealism, structure meets distortion. It's for those who find beauty in things that don’t quite make sense, an ode to the curious, the analytical dreamers, and the lovers of paradox"
